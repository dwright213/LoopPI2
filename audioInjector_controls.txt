TO DO:

- Clean up the setup shell scripts. The setup procedures for the older wm5102 soundcards probably isn't needed anymore.

- work out a way to make chuck recognize loop down and loop up, with a varying loop length, possibly up to 8 seconds. only having 8 second loops isn't really gonna work.

- if the above isn't possible, then allow a bpm setting, and then quantize loop length by measure, like how the Kaoss Pads work.

- maybe start thinking about switching the padkontrol out for the FCB1010. Will probably require more thoughtful midi handling. Will the audio injector help with that somehow?
